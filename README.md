To create the database, run the db_maker code.

db_maker runs the four files in db_make_files folder in the order of create_database, randomize_users, fill_activities, fill_recipes, randomize_reviews.
Creating the database takes a while.

To test the database, run the db_tester.py code.

To interact with the database, use the db_interactor, which has functions that reference db_transactions.py
